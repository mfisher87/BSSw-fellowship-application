### What impact do you foresee from your efforts? (1000 - 1500 characters)

I expect that my work will increase the number of researchers and research software
engineers collaborating comfortably, openly, and effectively on GitHub by lowering
psychological and technical barriers to community participation and leadership. By
enabling more researchers to comfortably participate in open science, I expect the
quality of scientific outcomes to increase, gauged by surveying community members at the
beginning and end of my fellowship. To ensure my work is findable and widely
disseminated, I will create bi-directional links between these new materials and other
valuable educational materials like NASA TOPS and Scientific Python.

Documenting common patterns of discomfort and remediations will empower researchers to
make better decisions; for example, by educating about legal protections from licenses
and technical protections from code metadata, DOIs, and automated archival, fears about
“scooping” or intellectual theft can be assuaged, leading to better decision-making.
Additionally, educating researchers in creating positive community interactions will
create a virtuous cycle of positive experiences that reduce apprehension about open work
modes. 

Additionally, this experience will provide professional growth that allows me to pursue
my interests in education and community-owned software development and enables me to
train others to do the same. I plan to synergize with other Fellows by sharing what I
learn and soliciting lessons from others.
