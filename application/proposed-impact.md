### What impact do you foresee from your efforts? (1000 - 1500 characters)

Position researchers and research software engineers to create, lead, and contribute to
open communities on GitHub. Create a feedback cycle of positive experiences leading to
more positive experiences that reduces apprehension about open work modes. [TODO: Much more
on community impact!!!]

[TODO: Impact for me: I expect a BSSw Fellowship to be a major career growth opportunity
that enables me to do more open community-owned software work, and also to train others
to do the same.]
