Several experiences in 2022 and 2023 caused me to realize a new passion for teaching and
advocacy for inclusive scientific sofware development practices. These experiences
included various community interactions, joining several new communities (NASA
Openscapes, CSCCE), and becoming a maintainer and/or contributor of several open-source
projects (matplotlib/viscm, nsidc/earthaccess, conda/conda-lock, conda-forge
feedstocks). The most significant experience contributing to my new passion was
co-leading the development of the QGreenland 2023 Researcher Workshop, a 3-day hands-on
open source workshop focused on geospatial data standards and practices.

In creating this workshop with my colleague Trey Stafford and PI Twila Moon, I
benefitted from collaborations with education experts in the CIRES Education & Outreach
office, cloud computing experts with CryoCloud and 2i2c, and domain experts
participating in our workshop from all career levels and from around the world. Positive
interactions with these communities and the satisfaction of creating open educational
materials that will continue to be useful was one of the most rewarding experiences of
my career, and I'm motivated to continue down this path.

My collaborations with 2i2c resulted in a post on the Jupyter blog
(<https://blog.jupyter.org/desktop-gis-software-in-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-ddced297019a>),
and my collaborations with Openscapes eventually resulted in a role as an Openscapes
Mentor. Through this role, I will take The Carpentries Instructor Training, which will
improve my skill at producing educational materials and delivering trainings.
