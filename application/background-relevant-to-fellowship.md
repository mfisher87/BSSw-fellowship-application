### Describe your background and experience relevant to being a BSSw Fellow (1000 - 1500 characters)

Several experiences in 2022-2023 inspired my passion for teaching and advocating for
inclusive scientific software development practices. These included joining open
communities, becoming a maintainer and contributor of several open-source projects, and
most significantly, co-authoring and presenting the QGreenland 2023 Researcher Workshop.

In co-creating the workshop, I benefited from collaborations with education experts from
CIRES Education & Outreach, cloud infrastructure experts from CryoCloud and 2i2c, and
the 25 international domain experts of all career levels who participated in our
workshop. Learning from these brilliant people and creating rich and open educational
materials that have proven valuable to other educators has been the most rewarding
experience of my career, and I’m motivated to continue this work.

Documenting this effort, I wrote a Jupyter blog post [^jupyter-blog-post] that inspired
others to replicate our work. I am also collaborating with Openscapes lead and 2022 BSSw
Fellow Julie Stewart Lowndes: I have been increasing my practice in mentoring others
through my role as a NASA Openscapes Mentor and through Carpentries Instructor Training.
My technical background and newly awakened passion for inclusiveness and education,
combined with the relationships I’ve built in open communities, position me for success
as a BSSw Fellow.
