### What would you do as a BSSw Fellow? (1000 - 1500 characters)

Current approaches to helping researchers adopt open collaboration patterns largely
focus on technical training – teaching new tools and workflows. However, from my
experience developing and teaching an open science workshop, mentoring individual
researchers in open science practices, and open science strategic planning, learning is
often stymied by discomfort.

To fill this gap, I will develop within the Openscapes community a “GitHub group”, an
open, safe, and supportive community of practice to help researchers comfortably
participate in and lead communities on GitHub. I will seed this community with
additional members from NSIDC, QGreenland, NASA EOSDIS, Jupyter, CryoCloud, and Center
for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement. I will interview community
members to gauge needs and growth over the performance period, establish open
communication on GitHub Discussions, and identify patterns of discomfort and effective
practices for addressing fears and concerns with open work modes. Community members will
also help identify priorities and ensure the scope of work is achievable.

With the aid of this valuable input, I will create online documentation and, if budget
allows, educational videos for common needs and pitfalls, facilitate community
collaboration, and provide technical and emotional support. These materials will include
tutorials, curated links to external resources, and guidance for researchers to
participate in and lead open source communities.
