I've been a software engineer for 15 years. After leaving the financial sector 7 years
ago, I joined NSIDC to pursue my interest in scientific software and open source. During
my time at NSIDC, I've become an advocate for open science and software verifiability,
and my interests have developed in to passions. My work has included:

* Authored NSIDC Git Training, a work-in-progress technical resource for researchers
  learning to work on GitHub (<https://nsidc-git-training.readthedocs.io>).

* Authored/collaborated on various NSIDC scientific visualization applications
  (ChArctic, Snow Today, Arctic Rain on Snow Study Interactive Map, Sea Ice Outlook)

* Volunteer maintainer of matplotlib/viscm: Software for visualizing, analyzing, and
  designing scientific colormaps that are perceptually uniform and accessible by people
  with color vision deficiency.

* Volunteer maintainer of nsidc/earthaccess: Software for improving accessibility of
  NASA Earth Science data in Python. Successfully advocated for a community-led
  governance model.

* Developer for Sea Ice Index: Software for building a database of sea ice statistics,
  and generating sea ice imagery and geospatial data files.

* Developer for Images of Antarctic Ice Shelves (NSIDC0102): An ongoing dataset of
  images of Antarctic ice shelves susceptible to rapid change.
