I’ve been a software engineer for 15 years. In 2016, I left the financial sector to join
the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and pursue my interests in scientific
software, open source, and education. While at NSIDC, I’ve become an advocate for open
science and software sustainability, and my interests have developed into passions. My
work has included:

* Co-lead author for source code of QGreenland [^qgreenland], a free and open-source
  interdisciplinary scientific data package; and QGreenland 2023 Researcher Workshop
  [^qgreenland-workshop], an open-source workshop focused on standards-based geospatial data practices.

* Lead author for NSIDC Git Training [^git-training].

* Inaugural member of NSIDC Open Science strategic planning group.

* Member of 2023 NASA Openscapes Mentor cohort.

* Member of open science communities: Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community
  Engagement (CSCCE), CryoCloud, NSIDC DEI working group.

* Author of NSIDC scientific visualization software: ChArctic (9.8% of traffic to
  nsidc.org), Snow Today, Arctic Rain on Snow Survey Interactive Map, Sea Ice Outlook.

* Author of data processing software for NSIDC Sea Ice Index and Images of Antarctic Ice
  Shelves.

* Volunteer maintainer of open source scientific software: matplotlib/viscm,
  nsidc/earthaccess.

* Volunteer contributor to conda-lock, a tool for creating reproducible software
  environments.
