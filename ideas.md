# Ideas

* Lower barriers (technological and psychological) to research development and community engagement on GitHub
    * Licensing
    * Citation metadata
    * Tools for community engagement
    * Examples and implementations of community engagement practices
    * Examples of positive community interactions

* Organize contents by concern, e.g.:
    * Concern about scooping:
        * Open work protects you. 
        * Zenodo archivals are proof of work.
        * License and copyright provide legal protection.
    * Concern about failing in public: ...

* Train open source projects and potential contributors
    * Onboard projects with training, tools, and checklists for open community
      engagement and creating positive interactions.
    * Automatically aggregate "good first issue" from these projects in one place
    * Train would-be contributors how to work in the open. Archive examples of completed
      issues.

* Leverage community connections to build an asynchronous learning cohort of researchers
  adapting to open science. This cohort can be of arbitrary size using GitHub
  Discussions (+ Slack?). Build all materials in service of and with input/feedback
  from this cohort.
    * Overlap / conflict with TOPS?


## Title phrasing

* "Demystifying"?
* "Techniques for ..."
* "Best practices for ..."


## Side benefits

* Update Scientific Python Developer Guide / copier template with software citation
